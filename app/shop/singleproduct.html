            <p>The adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 “Citrin” is a September 2019 release of the popular Yeezy model. Reminiscent of two prior 350 V2 releases, the “Lundmark” and “Sesame” designs, the “Citrin” edition is built with the same intricate Primeknit weave with transparent side stripes, but this time features tan and pale yellow tints. The citrus-like yellow hue is also found on the monofilament side stripes, as well as the translucent rubber midsole. The outsole receives a reddish tint to the translucent gum rubber to complete the colorway. The “Citrin” design omits the heel tab found on most Yeezy 350 V2 releases.
